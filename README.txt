Ming posted his first commit after adding a README to the repo.
He then added a "phrase that pays".
Then he updated the text, added an image, and added new assets, including a
     smiley, over the course of a few commits.
Then he updated the README, and afterwards he deleted everything from
     Spring 2013.
